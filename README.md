The notebooks 0,1,2,3,4 does not have a valid path to the data, mainly due to data privacy reasons.
The computed SHAP values are available in the data folder. Cross-validation evaluation files will also be submitted in the USB device.

The notebook 5 is aimed to demonstrate the application discussed in the thesis. It can be run, it does a valid path to the necessary files (except the Cox PH model which will not be in the repository but is available in the USB device, due to file size restrictions)
